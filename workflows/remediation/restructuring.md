## Moving Records and Captures

### Moving Collections

- Collection records cannot be moved
  - If you need to move a collection record, it must first be [converted](#converting-collections)

### Moving Containers

#### Moving Containers Within a Collection

1. Navigate to the **Overview** tab of the collection or container record where the container you would like to move is located
1. In the table that lists containers below the overview, locate the container you would like to move
1. In the **Actions** column of the container's row, click **See actions**
1. In the **Choose Action** pop-up, open the dropdown under **Actions** and select **Move container**
1. In the **Move container** pop-up, begin typing the title or **Record ID** of the container in the **Move to (leave blank for root/collection):** field and select the container from the search results
   1. The **Record ID** of the container can be located as the numeric slug of the URL for the container in MMS, e.g., [https://metadata.nypl.org/containers/**269804**](https://metadata.nypl.org/containers/269804)
   1. To move the item record to the top-level collection where the item is currently located, leave the field blank
   1. Click **Update**
1. On the **Confirm move** page:
   1. Review any **Current inherited elements** compared to the **New inherited elements** to note any metadata elements that will be lost or added as a result of the move that may need to be adjusted in the next step
   1. Once you are ready to complete the move, click **Yes** under **Do you really want to do this?**
1. Review the container in its new location
   1. Ensure no metadata elements were inadvertently lost or added as a result of the move by reviewing the **Descriptive metadata** tab of the container 
   1. Ensure all child items within the container meet the [minimum metadata requirements](/metadata-documentation/metadata/guidelines/#minimum-metadata-requirements) by reviewing the **Descriptive metadata** tab of the respective item record(s)
   1. Ensure all child items within the container have rights assigned by reviewing the **Rights section** found in the **Overview** tab of the respective item record(s)
      1. If rights are needed, follow the [rights workflow](/metadata-documentation/workflows/rights/) and include a link to the previous location of the container if rights were assigned there
1. Once you have confirmed all metadata elements and rights are in place in the container's new location, you may [delete](/metadata-documentation/workflows/remediation/deleting/) any collection or container records that are now empty and no longer needed as a result of moving the container

### Moving Items

#### Moving Items out of a Collection or Container to Be a Standalone Item

- See [Converting Items](#converting-items)

#### Moving Standalone Items to a Collection or Container

1. Navigate to any tab of the item record
1. Below the title and UUID of the item record, click **Move to new collection**
1. Enter the **Record ID** of the destination collection in the **Enter a collection id** field
   1. The **Record ID** of the collection can be located as the numeric slug of the URL for the collection in MMS, e.g., [https://metadata.nypl.org/collection/**50630**](https://metadata.nypl.org/collection/50630)
   1. Click **Add to Collection**
1. If the destination collection has containers, you will see a page to **Select container**
   1. If you want to move the item to a container, click the radio button for the container where the item should be located and click **Select**
   1. If you want to move the item to the top-level collection, click **Select** without choosing a container
1. On the **Confirm move** page, click **Yes** under **Do you really want to do this?**
   1. Review the **Will be lost** compared to the **Will be gained** to note any metadata elements that will be lost or added as a result of the move that may need to be adjusted in the next step
   1. Once you are ready to complete the move, click **Yes** under **Do you really want to do this?**
1. Review the item in its new location
   1. Ensure no redundant metadata elements were added as a result of the move by reviewing the **Descriptive metadata** tab of the item
   1. Ensure the item retained its rights profile by reviewing the **Rights section** found in the **Overview tab** of the item record

#### Moving Items to a Different Collection
