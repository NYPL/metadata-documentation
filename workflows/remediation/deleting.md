## Overview

{: .warning }
Deleted records cannot be restored within MMS, so take caution to ensure all criteria have been met before proceeding with any deletion.

- In general, records should only be deleted in one of the following circumstances:
  - As part of a remediation workflow, e.g. [Restructuring Records](/metadata-documentation/workflows/remediation/restructuring/) or [Reimporting Metadata](/metadata-documentation/workflows/remediation/reimporting/)
  - If records were accidentally created
- Item, container, and collection records should only be deleted if there are no associated capture records or assets
  - For items, confirm that the text `No captures yet created for this item.` is present on the **Capture inventory** tab
  - For containers or collections, confirm that the text `Total items in this Container 0` or `Total items in this Collection 0` is present on the **Lightbox view** tab
  - If capture records exist but display a broken image icon appears instead of thumbnails, see [Capture Records in MMS with No Assets](/metadata-documentation/workflows/troubleshooting/#capture-record-in-mms-with-no-assets)
- Before deleting a record, confirm it is no longer needed for reference
  - Ensure all necessary metadata elements from the record have been replicated elsewhere if needed
  - Ensure the rights profile from the record has been replicated elsewhere by a Digitization Coordinator (DC) if needed
    - If a rights profile needs to be moved, follow the [rights](/metadata-documentation/workflows/rights/) workflow and include a link to the legacy record
