## Overview

{: .warning }
Deleted records and captures cannot be restored within MMS, so take caution to ensure all the guidelines below have been met before proceeding with any deletion.

- Records and captures can only be deleted if they are empty
  - Empty records do not have digital assets associated with the record itself or any child containers or items
  - Empty captures do not have digital assets associated with the capture
- Before deleting a record or capture, ensure it is no longer needed for reference
  - Ensure all necessary metadata elements from an empty record have been replicated elsewhere if needed
  - Ensure the rights profile from an empty record has been replicated elsewhere by a Digitization Coordinator (DC) if needed
    - If a rights profile needs to be moved, follow the [rights](/metadata-documentation/workflows/rights/) workflow and include a link to the empty record
