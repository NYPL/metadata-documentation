Deleted records cannot be restored within MMS, so take caution to ensure all criteria have been met before proceeding with any deletion.

- Records can only be deleted if they are empty
  - See the section that corresponds to the record type for criteria as to what is considered empty
- Before deleting a record, confirm it is no longer needed for reference
  - Ensure all necessary metadata elements from an empty record have been replicated elsewhere if needed
  - Ensure the rights profile from an empty record has been replicated elsewhere by a Digitization Coordinator (DC) if needed
  - If a rights profile needs to be moved, follow the [rights](/metadata-documentation/workflows/rights/) workflow and include a link to the empty record
