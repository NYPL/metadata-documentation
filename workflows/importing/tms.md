# Importing TMS Records
{: .no_toc }

Describes how to create records in the Metadata Management System (MMS) by importing metadata from records cataloged in [The Museum System](/metadata-documentation/resources/glossary/#the-museum-system) (TMS)

{: .warning-title }
> Known Issue
>
> [TMS](/metadata-documentation/resources/glossary/#the-museum-system) and the [Prints & Photographs Online Catalog](/metadata-documentation/resources/glossary/#prints-photographs-online-catalog) were sunset in February 2024. While TMS records can no longer be imported, source data about items in the Print Collection and Photography Collection can manually copied from [Prints and Photographs Discovery](https://ppd.nypl.org/) (PPD) while import into MMS is not supported.

## Overview
- ~~Records for [Print Collection](/metadata-documentation/division/print/) and [Photography Collection](/metadata-documentation/division/photography/) cataloged in [The Museum System](/metadata-documentation/resources/glossary/#the-museum-system) (TMS) and accessible via the [Prints & Photographs Online Catalog](https://wallachprintsandphotos.nypl.org/) (PPOC) can be imported into MMS using the [TMS ID](/metadata-documentation/metadata/element/identifier/tms/)~~
- ~~TMS records always correspond an [item](/metadata-documentation/metadata/record-type/#items) in MMS~~
  - ~~The **Alternate Titles** field in PPOC may indicate the name of the series to which an item belongs, which may correlate with a collection or container in MMS where the item should be located~~
  - ~~See [Print Collection](/metadata-documentation/division/print/) and [Photography Collection](/metadata-documentation/division/photography/) guidelines to determine what structure is appropriate for an item~~

## Steps
1. ~~Determine the appropriate structure for the TMS record, and if necessary, find or create the necessary collection and/or container record(s)~~
   1. ~~See [Print Collection](/metadata-documentation/division/print/) and [Photography Collection](/metadata-documentation/division/photography/) guidelines to determine what structure is appropriate for an item~~
   1. ~~The **Alternate Titles** field in the [Prints & Photographs Online Catalog](https://wallachprintsandphotos.nypl.org/) may indicate the name of the series to which an item belongs~~
      1. ~~Search MMS for the value in **Alternate Titles** to check that a record does not already exist that corresponds to the series~~
      1. ~~Search the [Research Catalog](/metadata-documentation/resources/glossary/#research-catalog) or [Legacy Catalog](/metadata-documentation/resources/glossary/#legacy-catalog) for the value in **Alternate Titles** to see if the series is represented by a MARC record~~
         1. ~~If you find a MARC record for the series, [import the MARC record](/metadata-documentation/workflows/importing/marc/)~~
   1. ~~If you have confirmed the item should be in a collection or container and verified that it does not yet exist, [create the collection or container](/metadata-documentation/workflows/creating/) according to the [Print Collection](/metadata-documentation/division/print/) and [Photography Collection](/metadata-documentation/division/photography/) guidelines~~
1. ~~Determine the [TMS ID](/metadata-documentation/metadata/element/identifier/tms/) of the TMS record you want to import~~
   1. ~~In the [Prints & Photographs Online Catalog](https://wallachprintsandphotos.nypl.org/), the TMS ID can be found as the numeric slug in the URL displayed in your address bar when viewing a record~~
   1. ~~See [TMS ID](/metadata-documentation/metadata/element/identifier/tms/) for additional context and guidelines~~
1. ~~Check that a record does not already exist in MMS that corresponds to the TMS record~~
   1. ~~Search MMS for the [TMS ID](/metadata-documentation/metadata/element/identifier/tms/)~~
   1. ~~If you receive no results, search MMS for other descriptive metadata displayed in PPOC (such as the **Title** and [**Object Number**](/metadata-documentation/metadata/element/identifier/tms-object-number/)) to confirm a corresponding record does not yet exist as sometimes a TMS ID may be missing~~
   1. ~~If you find an item record already exists in MMS, use it rather than reimporting the TMS record~~
1. ~~Navigate to the **Create Item(s) from External IDs** page in MMS:~~
   1. ~~Via the menu bar using either path:~~
      1. ~~**Imports** › **Item from External ID**~~
      1. ~~**Items** › **New** › **Skip form and import from external source**~~
   1. ~~Alternately, navigate to the record for the collection or container where the item should be located › **Overview** tab › bottom of page › **Import Via** › **External IDs**~~
      1. ~~Use this method if you found or created a collection or container in the first step~~
1. ~~Complete the import form~~
   1. ~~**Collection Owner** (required): select the division displayed in the **Department** field in PPOC~~
      1. ~~All items imported from TMS records will use either **Wallach Division: Photography Collection** or **Wallach Division: Print Collection**~~
      1. ~~See [Location](/metadata-documentation/metadata/element/location/)~~
   1. ~~**Type of Resource** (required): select the appropriate resource type~~
      1. ~~Generally, items imported from TMS records will use **still image**~~
      1. ~~See [Type of Resource](/metadata-documentation/metadata/element/type-of-resource/)~~
   1. ~~**Specify item(s) parent UUID, if applicable (will override org unit choice)** (optional): the [UUID](/metadata-documentation/resources/glossary/#universally-unique-identifier) of the collection or container where you wish the item to be located~~
      1. ~~Leave blank if importing a standalone item~~
      1. ~~Only one location can be specified, so if you are importing multiple TMS records, they must all belong in the same location~~
      1. ~~This field will be automatically populated if you have navigated to the form via the record for the collection or container where the item should be located~~
   1. ~~**Type of external IDs** (required): select `tms`~~
   1. ~~**Enter identifiers, separated by commas (limit 100)** (required): enter the [TMS ID](/metadata-documentation/metadata/element/identifier/tms/)~~
      1. ~~You may import up to 100 TMS records at a time by separating each bnumber with a comma~~
   1. ~~Click **Preview**~~
1. ~~Once you have verified the correct TMS record and metadata appear on the **Would Import As …** page, click **Import these records to MMS**~~
   1. ~~A confirmation message will be displayed~~
   1. ~~If importing only one TMS record, the new record will be displayed~~
   1. ~~If importing more than one TMS record, you can then search MMS for each record to proceed with next steps~~
1. ~~Review and [restructure](/metadata-documentation/workflows/remediation/restructuring/) your new record(s) as needed~~
   1. ~~See [Print Collection](/metadata-documentation/division/print/) and [Photography Collection](/metadata-documentation/division/photography/) guidelines to determine what structure is appropriate for an item~~
   1. ~~See [Moving Records](/metadata-documentation/workflows/remediation/restructuring/#moving-records) for how to move content to a new location~~
1. ~~Proceed with next steps according to the relevant [digitization](/metadata-documentation/workflows/digitization/) or [remediation](/metadata-documentation/workflows/remediation/) workflow~~
