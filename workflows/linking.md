# Linking Between Systems
{: .no_toc }

Provides an overview of the use of [identifiers](/metadata-documentation/metadata/element/identifier/) in the Metadata Management System (MMS) to support connections to and from Digital Collections (DC) from other patron-facing systems of the Library

{: .note }
If a link to or from Digital Collections is absent or broken, please let us know via our [Metadata Reporting Form](/metadata-documentation/contact/form/) so we can investigate.

## Research Catalog

### Digital Collections → Research Catalog

- When a [bnumber](/metadata-documentation/metadata/element/identifier/#nypl-catalog-id-b-number) is present in MMS for an collection, container, or item, a link to the Research Catalog will automatically appear on that entity's page on DC
    - From a collection or container view, the linked bnumber can be found on the **About** tab in the **Identifiers** section as **NYPL catalog ID (B-number)**
    - From an item view, a link can be found in two places:
        - In the right column titled **View This Item Elsewhere** in a box titled **NYPL Catalog** and **View this item in the NYPL Catalog**
        - Towards the end of the descriptive metadata in the **Identifiers** section as **NYPL catalog ID (B-number)**
    - If more than one bnumber is present on an MMS record, only one link will be linked from the **View This Item Elsewhere** column but every bnumber and its corresponding link will appear in the **Identifiers** section

### Research Catalog → Digital Collections

- When a [bnumber](/metadata-documentation/metadata/element/identifier/#nypl-catalog-id-b-number) is added in MMS to a collection, container, or item that has met the [criteria to appear in DC](/metadata-documentation/dc/criteria/), a link to DC will be added to the corresponding catalog record
    - In the [Research Catalog](/metadata-documentation/resources/glossary/#research-catalog), the link can be found under the **Available Online** heading or the **Connect to:** section as **NYPL Digital Collections**
    - In the [Legacy Catalog](/metadata-documentation/resources/glossary/#legacy-catalog), the link can be found under the **Connect to:** heading as NYPL Digital Collections
    - Links to DC are added to the bibliographic record in Sierra
        - Links to DC should use the standardized MARC 856 field:<br><tt>856 41 |u<span style="background: #ffffcc; border: 1px solid #5c5962;">URL</span>|zNYPL Digital Collections</tt>
    - URLs are formatted according to our [URL Structure](/metadata-documentation/dc/url-structure/) documentation, and then run through the Library's [Link Minter](/metadata-documentation/resources/glossary/#link-minter) tool
- Links to DC are periodically batch added to Sierra by the ​​Library's Integrated Library Systems Team (ILS Team) using data supplied by the Metadata Services Unit (MSU)
    - This workflow is still being refined, but our current goal is to supply refreshed data to the Library’s ILS Team on a regular basis so they can perform batch updates
    - Past batches of supplied links can be found in the [Data Supplied to ILS Team 🔒](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ktPZqRYoIv0yJIWTwLDeRhM766GKaDU7?usp=sharing) folder in Google Drive
    - Library staff with relevant permissions can access related scripts in our [metadata-tools 🔒](https://github.com/NYPL/metadata-tools/tree/master/_quarterly_bnumber) repo
- Use our [Metadata Reporting Form](/metadata-documentation/contact/form/) if links from the Research Catalog to DC are absent or broken

## Archives Portal

### Digital Collections → Archives Portal

#### Via MSS Unit ID
- When an [MSS Unit ID](/metadata-documentation/metadata/element/identifier/#mss-unit-id) is present on an MMS collection, container, or item, the **MSS Unit ID** numeric string will automatically appear on that entity's page on DC
    - From a collection or container view, the collection's **MSS Unit ID** numeric string can be found on the **About** tab in the **Identifiers** section as **MSS Unit ID**
    - From an item view, the **MSS Unit ID** numeric string can be found towards the end of the descriptive metadata in the **Identifiers** section as **MSS Unit ID**
- The **MSS Unit ID** identifiers on DC do not link to the [Archives Portal](/metadata-documentation/resources/glossary/#archives-portal)
- To navigate to the Archives Portal collection that corresponds to content in Digital Collections, append the MSS Unit ID numeric string to <tt>https://archives.nypl.org/</tt>

#### Via Archives EAD ID and Archives Components ID
- When an [Archives EAD ID](https://nypl.github.io/metadata-documentation/metadata/element/identifier/#archives-ead-id) is present on an MMS item, the **Archives EAD ID** link will automatically appear on that item's page on DC
    - From an item view, the **Archives EAD ID** link can be found towards the end of the descriptive metadata in the **Identifiers** section as **Archives EAD ID**
    - Clicking the link will take you to the item's finding aid component in the Archives Portal and will resolve to a URL that uses the [Archives Components ID](/metadata-documentation/metadata/element/identifier/other-local/#archives-components-id)

### Archives Portal → Digital Collections
- When a digitized asset is available via the Archives Portal (via [Archives EAD ID](/metadata-documentation/metadata/element/identifier/archives-ead/)), an icon and clickable link will be present to the left of the associated finding aid component
    - For non-AMI materials, the icon will be a film strip (🎞️)
    - For AMI materials, the icon will either be music notes (🎶) for sound recordings or a film camera (📽️) for moving images
- For all three icons, opening the link in a new tab will take the user directly to the corresponding record on Digital Collections
