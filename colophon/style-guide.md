# Style Guide
{: .no_toc }

## Table of contents
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

1. TOC
{:toc}

## Acronyms
- Always write out the first time a name appears on a page with acronym in brackets, i.e. "Metadata Management System (MMS)"
- Subsequent references in the same page can use acronym, i.e. "MMS"

## Capitalization
- Use Title Case for page title and headers
- Use Sentence case for body text, bullet points, and notes
- Avoid all caps unless an acronym (some text element's styles such as its "Heading 4" are made all caps by Just the Docs CSS)

## Structure
- Use bulleted and numbered lists with each statement its own line
- Avoid multi-sentence paragraphs except in notes

## Periods
- Avoid use of periods except in Notes, try to separate out sentences with bullet points

## Referencing Interface Text
- When writing out steps of interacting with an interface and referring to specific text that is part of an interface, bold the exact text, i.e. "Click **OK** to proceed" if the button on the interface says "OK"

## Notes
- Use Just the Doc's callout feature for note formatting, which can be more narrative/provide additional context and contain multiple sentences with periods; keep these simple

## Table of Contents
- Use page table of contents when 2 or more sections
- If a page, generally avoid adding text beyond a sentence at the top otherwise TOC gets buried

## See Also Section
- If there are links to other relevant resources either within metadata-documentation or beyond, include a "See Also" section with each link as its own bullet point, i.e.
  **See Also**
  [Metadata Liaisons and Contacts 🔒](https://nypl.github.io/metadata-documentation/resources/glossary/#:~:text=nypl.org/work_orders%20%F0%9F%94%92-,See%20Also,for%20a%20complete%20list%20of%20research%20library%20division%20acronyms%20and%20names,-DIRES%20Onboarding%20Terms) for a complete list of research library division acronyms and names

## Links to Protected Documents
- If linked to a document such as in Google Drive or Lair that are not publicly accessible, append the link's label with a 🔒

## Language
- When referring to MSU, use "we," "us," "our," etc.; i.e. "contact **us**," "**our** preferred link structure is…," "**we** recommend"
- When referring to NYPL, say "the Library"
