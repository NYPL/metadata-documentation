Located within the New York Public Library's [Digital Research Division](https://www.nypl.org/digital-research), the Metadata Services Unit (MSU) increases access and discovery of library resources and strengthens data interoperability across the library. Our team supports and engages staff in efficient metadata creation, assessment, enhancement, and remediation for resources digitized for NYPL Digital Collections. We provide staff training, project consultation, and documentation of local standards and practices. To this end, the MSU supports the improvement and maintenance of our Metadata Management System (MMS) and Digital Collections on product development teams.
