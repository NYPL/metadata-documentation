## Guidelines
- Digitization requests submitted to the Library by the public are tracked internally using a sequential PO number recognizable as they begin with "PO," e.g. `PO64824`, which can be found in the following places:
  - [New Digitization â€º New Digitization Approvals ðŸ”’](https://app.clickup.com/2305128/v/l/6-180919377-1) in ClickUp
  - [New Digitization â€º New Digitization Tracking ðŸ”’](https://app.clickup.com/2305128/v/l/6-164664866-1) in ClickUp
  - [Work Orders ðŸ”’](https://metadata.nypl.org/work_orders) in the Metadata Management System (MMS)
- When adding a **Photo Order** value to a record in MMS, only include numeric characters as the identifier value, e.g., `64824` rather than `PO64824`
- Add **Photo Order** values at the item-level
  - A **Photo Order** value may be added to multiple items
  - If an item has more than one **Photo Order** value, add an admin note to indicate which captures are associated with which **Photo Order**
  - If a **Photo Order** value only applies to some of an item's captures rather than all of the captures, add an admin note to indicate which captures are associated with the **Photo Order**
