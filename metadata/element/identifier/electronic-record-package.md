## Source
- Assigned by archivist during processing of born-digital material (see [Archivist Workstation Processing Instructions](https://nypl.github.io/digarch/staging/Archivist-Workstation-Processing.html))

## Guidelines
- **Electronic Record Package** identifiers are automatically imported into their respective MMS container and/or item records when [importing an EAD-encoded finding aid](/metadata-documentation/workflows/import/#importing-finding-aids) into MMS
- For large and/or complex collections with EAD-encoded finding aids where a sizeable number of records are missing **Electronic Record Package** identifiers, reimporting the finding aid is recommended
    - After reimporting, relocate captures and request reassignment of rights to ensure all of the archives-related identifiers are correct in MMS
- For smaller or less complex collections, it may be more time effective to manually adding missing **Electronic Record Package** identifiers to the respective container and item records
- If adding a **Electronic Record Package** identifier manually for a container or item, it can be located with the following methods:
    - In the [Archives Portal](/metadata-documentation/resources/glossary/#archives-portal), the **Electronic Record Package** identifier can be found on the **Detailed Description** tab to the left of an item or container's title ([see example](https://archives.nypl.org/dan/23068#c1329153))
    - In the [Archives Portal Admin Interface](/metadata-documentation/resources/glossary/#archives-portal-admin-interface), the **Electronic Record Package** identifier can be found in the unitid field with the `"type"=>"local_mss_er"` in records with `/components/` in the URL ([see example](https://archives.nypl.org/admin/components/1329153#:~:text=%7B%22value%22%3D%3E%22er.2%22%2C%20%22type%22%3D%3E%22local_mss_er%22%7D))

## Inheritance
- If an item record with an **Electronic Record Package** identifier is converted to a container, set the **Electronic Record Package** to be **Inheritable**

## Use With
- [Archives EAD ID](/metadata-documentation/metadata/element/identifier/archives-ead/), which correlates [EAD](/metadata-documentation/resources/glossary/#encoded-archival-description)-encoded finding aid components to their MMS container or item records, facilitating the display of digitized assets in the [Archives Portal](/metadata-documentation/resources/glossary/#archives-portal)
