## Source
- Internal exhibition checklists created by NYPL staff

## Guidelines
- Reference an exhibition checklist to find the **NYPL Exhibition ID**
    - Exhibition checklists are typically linked from a task for the exhibition in [**ClickUp â€º New Digitization â€º New Digitization Tracking ðŸ”’**](https://app.clickup.com/2305128/v/l/6-164664866-1)
    - **NYPL Exhibition IDs** are widely used for exhibitions at the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building (SASB) and Library for the Performing Arts (LPA), but they have historically not been as commonly used for exhibitions at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture
- **NYPL Exhibition ID** values are made up of two components: an exhibition number and an [item number](https://metadata.nypl.org/items/5955168?section=desc_md#:~:text=NYPL%20Exhibition%20ID%3A-,TL%2020.01.FORT09,-Location)
    - Exhibition number
        - Found in the [Exhibitions Master List ðŸ”’](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11-bgNRs2iO6HLG8OQv7quP8KUHCUNxJgC3nIapA0Do0/edit) in the **TL number** (temporary location number) column
        - Generated by the Registrar department
        - Exhibition numbers have three parts:
            - Exhibition location code
                - TL = Stephen A. Schwarzman Building (SASB)
                    - Some legacy non-SASB exhibition numbers may also start with TL
                - LPA = Library for the Performing Arts
                - SC = Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture
            - Exhibition year (in two-digit format)
                - Refers to the anticipated year the exhibition is expected to open, which may vary from actual exhibition dates or remain static for rotating exhibitions, e.g. _Treasures_
            - Exhibition sequence for the year
                - SASB exhibitions begin with 001
                - LPA exhibitions begin with 501
                - Schomburg exhibitions begin with 701
    - Item number
        - Most are sequential and begin with 001
        - Found in the exhibition checklist
        - Some exhibitions such as _Treasures_ may have their own unique object numbering system that reflects thematic groupings
- Add **NYPL Exhibition ID** values at the item-level
    - The full **NYPL Exhibition ID** (composed of the parts listed above) is typically unique to one item, but exceptions may arise
    - If an item has more than one NYPL Exhibition ID, add an admin note to indicate which captures are associated with which NYPL Exhibition ID
    - If an **NYPL Exhibition ID** only applies to some of an item's captures rather than all of the captures, add an admin note to indicate which captures are associated with the NYPL Exhibition ID

## Format

{: .note }
Ensure spacing and periods match below example, i.e. a space after the exhibition location code and periods separating the other components.

### URL Format to Search Digital Collections

Consistent usage and formatting of **NYPL Exhibition IDs** allow construction of a URL that searches Digital Collections for any publicly accessible items related to that exhibition:
<dl>
<dt>URL structure</dt>
<dd><tt>https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/search/index?filters[identifier_idx_local_exhibition]=<span style="background: #ffccff; border: 1px solid #5c5962;">exhibition number</span></tt></dd>
