## Guidelines
- The **TMS Object Number** is automatically populated into records when [importing TMS records](/metadata-documentation/workflows/importing/tms/)
- ~~If adding a **TMS Object Number** to a record manually, it can be located in the [Prints & Photographs Online Catalog](https://wallachprintsandphotos.nypl.org/) as the **Object Numbe**r displayed in the record ([see example](https://wallachprintsandphotos.nypl.org/catalog/302742#:~:text=Object%20Number%3A-,99109,-Description%3A))~~
