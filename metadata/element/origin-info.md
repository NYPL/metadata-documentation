#### Guidelines
{: .no_toc }

- Date is a required element
  - If no date can be found, you must estimate a date or date range (i.e. decade or century)
  - If a container or item record has a narrower date than is inherited from a higher-level collection or container, disinherit the **Origin Info** element and add the narrower date to a given container or item
- Select the appropriate date **Type** from the dropdown
  - Use **Date created** for most unpublished materials
  - Use **Date issued** for most published materials
  - Do not use **Date captured**, **Copyright date**, or **Other date**
    - Dates related to ownership, copyright, gift, etc. can be expressed as free text in a [**Note**](/metadata-documentation/metadata/element/note/) element with the [**Type**](/metadata-documentation/metadata/element/note/#type) "date" with a prefix for context, e.g. "Gift: 1937"
- Add the relevant date(s) encoded as a **Single date** or **Date range**
  - Select **Single date** if you know the point in time a resource was created or issued
    - If adding more than one **Single date** field, select the most relevant encoded date as **Key date**
  - Select **Date range** if the date of a resource is provided as range or you are uncertain about the point in time a resource was created or issued
    - Enter a range of dates (no matter how broad) to narrow down the date, e.g. to express that a resource was created in the 1920s, select **Date range**, enter a **Start date** of 1920 and an **End date** of 1929 and select **approximate** for the **Qualifier** of both fields
    - Indicate the **Start date** of the range as the **Key date**
  - Enter the most specific date known in the **Year**, **Month**, and **Day** fields
    - **Year** is required, while **Month** and **Day** are optional
    - By default all date(s) are set to **CE** to indicate the date is common era
    - If a date is before the common era (BCE), toggle the radio button to **BCE**
  - Select a **Qualifier** if appropriate for any dates to indicate that they are approximate, inferred, or questionable
    - Select **approximate** for uncertain date ranges and for "circa" dates that are not guaranteed to be exact
    - Select **inferred** for known dates not transcribed directly from a resource
    - Select **questionable** for questionable dates
- Generally, dates should not be recorded free text using the **Text (for non-Gregorian calendar dates)** option
  - Non-Gregorian dates, decades, and seasons should be converted to their corresponding Gregorian date/range
    - Add a [**Note**](/metadata-documentation/metadata/element/note/) element with the [**Type**](/metadata-documentation/metadata/element/note/#type) "date" with a prefix for context that specifies the original calendar type, date, and date type, e.g. "Date issued: 1003 (Islamic calendar)" or "Date created: 1743 (Julian calendar)"
  - "Circa" or "approximate" dates can be recorded as an encoded date/range with the use of the relevant **Qualifier**
  - Dates provides as seasons, can be recorded using **Date range** to record the range of months that correspond to that season
    - Seasons in the Northern Hemisphere:
      - Winter: record month range 01–03
      - Spring: record month range 04–06
      - Summer: record month range 07–09
      - Fall: record month range 10–12
    - Seasons in the Southern Hemisphere:
      - Winter: record month range 07–09
      - Spring: record month range 10–12
      - Summer: record month range 01–03
      - Fall: record month range 04–06
    - Add a [Note](/metadata-documentation/metadata/element/note/) element with the [Type](/metadata-documentation/metadata/element/note/#type) "date" with a prefix for context that specifies the original calendar type, date, and date type, e.g. "Date issued: Summer 1968"
  - If you believe there to be a reason to record a date as **Text (for non-Gregorian calendar dates)**, discuss with the [Manager, Metadata Services](/metadata-documentation/contact/), before proceeding further
- For reprints, add the date of the reprint in the **Date issued field**, not the date of the original item's creation or issuance
  - You may put the original print date in a [**Note**](/metadata-documentation/metadata/element/note/) element with the [**Type**](/metadata-documentation/metadata/element/note/#type) "date" with a prefix for context, e.g. "Original: 1920"
