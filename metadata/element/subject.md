# Subject
{: .d-inline .v-align-middle .no_toc .mr-2 }
Repeatable
{: .d-inline .v-align-middle .label .label-green .mx-1 }
[View MODS Documentation →](https://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/userguide/subject.html)
{: .d-inline .v-align-middle .text-zeta .ml-2 }

A term or phrase representing the primary topic(s) on which a work is focused
{: .d-block .mt-2 .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Table of Contents
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

1. TOC
{:toc}

## Purpose
- To allow users to filter and explore resources by topic, place, time period, name subject, and work subject

## Guidelines
- Generally, **Subject** elements will be imported (from catalog records, finding aids, or TMS records) or added by Metadata Services Unit (MSU) staff
  - At least one subject is recommended
  - Only add **Subject** elements if you are familiar with relevant guidelines
  - See [Library of Congress Subject Headings: Online Training](https://www.loc.gov/catworkshop/lcsh/index.html) and [Library of Congress Subject Headings Manual](https://www.loc.gov/aba/publications/FreeSHM/freeshm.html)
- Determine the appropriate method to add a subject based on whether you wish to add a new, distinct subject or a subdivision
  - To add a new, distinct subject as its own element, click **+ Subject** 
  - To add a subdivision to create a complex subject heading, click the relevant type link to the right of **Add** within an existing **Subject** element
- When adding a new **Subject** element, start by searching within the available [controlled vocabularies](/metadata-documentation/metadata/guidelines/#controlled-vocabularies) using the MMS authorities module
  - Select the appropriate subject type (**Topical**, **Geographic**, **Temporal**, **Name**, **Title**, or **Occupation**) for each subject you enter
    - See [Subelements](#subelements) for guidelines for each subject type
  - Click **Select from controlled terms** to bring up the authorities module
  - Look up the subject you wish to add in the search box
    - The selected subject type will determine which **Authority** is searched, and consequently which terms are available
    - Reference relevant guidelines for the record's [division](https:///metadata-documentation/metadata/division/) and [material](https:///metadata-documentation/metadata/material/) to determine whether there is any relevant preference for terms from a particular **Authority**
  - To verify a result is appropriate, click the linked **Authorized Term** to view the corresponding record in the source **Authority**
    - Review the selected record to ensure the subject you are adding can be used as you intend, e.g. do not add subdivision as a main subject
  - Once you have confirmed the correct result, click the **Use this term** button in the **Action** column
  - Selecting a subject from the MMS authorities module automatically populates the [**Type**](#type) (where applicable), [**Authority**](#authority) and [**Value URI** ](#value-uri)attributes
- If you are not receiving the result you expect by searching the MMS authorities module, try searching the [Library of Congress Linked Data Service](https://id.loc.gov/)
  - It is possible that the subject you are searching exists in the [Library of Congress Linked Data Service](https://id.loc.gov/) but is not yet available or up-to-date in the MMS authorities module
  - This can occur because the MMS authorities module data is only periodically updated and therefore may out of sync with the current version of the [Library of Congress Linked Data Service](https://id.loc.gov/)
- If you are unable to find a subject using the **Authority data search**, you may add it as free text
  - If the authority exists in a particular vocabulary but it is not appearing for selection from the MMS authorities module, input the label, [**Authority**](#authority), and [**Value URI**](#value-uri) from LCSH or LCNAF manually
  - If you are uncertain of the subject type, either:
    - Review the **Instance Of** section of the subject authority
    - Open the **MARC/XML** (linked under **Alternate Formats**), and compare the number to tag of the authorized form to the numbers on the [MARC 21 Format for Authority Data](https://www.loc.gov/marc/authority/ad1xx3xx.html)
