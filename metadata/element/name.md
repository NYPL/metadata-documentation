    - Look up the name, organization, or event you wish to add in the search box

    - Once you have confirmed the correct result, click **Use this term**

    - If no results appear to be correct, try adjusting your search terms or search directly on the [Library of Congress Linked Data Service](https://id.loc.gov/) website
        - MMS only periodically updates the results that appear within the Authority data search, so sometimes names will be present in [Library of Congress Linked Data Service](https://id.loc.gov/) that are not yet in MMS
        - Search the [LC Name Authority File (LCNAF)](https://id.loc.gov/authorities/names.html) first as most authorities for the **Name** element will appear in that catalog
        - If you receive no results in LCNAF, search the [LC Subject Headings (LCSH)](https://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html).
        - If the authority you wish to use appears on the [Library of Congress Linked Data Service](https://id.loc.gov/), but not within MMS, follow the instructions below for adding a free text name
- If there is no Library of Congress Authority available via the **Authority data search**, select the radio button for **Free text**
    -   Search for the Name using the [LCNAF](https://id.loc.gov/authorities/names.html) or [LCSH](https://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html)
        -   If the authority exists in LCNAF/LCSH... [TK]
-   Search for the Name using [VIAF](https://viaf.org/)
    -   If the authority exists in VIAF... [TK]
-   If the person, organization, or event does not have an authority record in LCNAF, LCSH, or VIAF, manually enter the name according to the according to the relevant [content standard](/metadata-documentation/metadata/guidelines/#content-standards)
- The order of preference for values for name authorities isÂ 
    - LC Name Authority File (LCNAF) or LC Subject Headings (LCSH)
    - Virtual International Authority File (VIAF)
